## Background

This website intends to reference any kind of (possibly open) data initiative related to aviation. It is supported by a group of academics, researchers and aviation people working to bring the power of data in order to improve the current state of the art in aviation.

Our research interests include:
- air traffic management;
- air traffic operations;
- safety;
- security;
- environment;
- and more.

Access to data can be hard but lines are moving; more and more data is going public.  
The purpose of this website is to provide a reference to open sources of data in aviation. We obviously need your help to make this reference comprehensive.

## Contribute

This effort is made as an unofficial side project. There is more data being made available every day and you may have found more data sources that are not yet listed here.

Any help with respect to data sources, license information, grammar mistakes and typos, structure of the website, CSS design is more than welcome.

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/atmdata/atmdata.github.io/issues/new) or a [file a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the [github](https://github.com/atmdata/atmdata.github.io) of the website.
