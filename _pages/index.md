## Background

We are a group of academics, researchers and aviation people working to bring the power of data in order to improve the current state of the art in aviation.

Our research interests include:
- air traffic management;
- air traffic operations;
- safety;
- security;
- environment;
- and more.

Access to data can be hard but lines are moving; more and more data is going public.  
The purpose of this site is to provide an exhaustive reference to open sources of data in aviation.

## Contribute

This effort is made as an unofficial side project. There is more data being made available every day and you may have found more data sources that are not yet listed here.

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/atmdata/atmdata.github.io/issues/new) or a [PR]() on the github of the website.
