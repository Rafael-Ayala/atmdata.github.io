This page aims at referencing all kinds of (mostly open) data initiative related to aviation.

## Background

We are a group of academics, researchers and aviation people working to bring the power of data in order to improve the current state of the art in aviation.

Our concerns include:
- air traffic management
- operations
- safety
- security
- environment

Access to data can be hard but lines are moving; more and more data is going public.  
The purpose of this site is to provide an exhaustive reference to open sources of data in aviation.

## Structure

## Contribute

This effort is made as a side unofficial project. There is more data being made available every day and you may have found more data sources that are not yet listed here.

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/atmdata/atmdata.github.io/issues/new) or a [PR]() on the github of the website.
