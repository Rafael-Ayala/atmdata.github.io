We are a group of academics, researchers and aviation people, enthusiastic about open data. We created this website in an attempt to share information about all the open data and open-source initiatives related to aviation.

This space is supposed to be yours. Feel free to contribute and add you name to the list:

- [@xoolive](https://github.com/xoolive). I like maps 🌍, code 🐍 and data visualisation 😎. I keep an eye on anything that can fly 🛩️.
- [@junzis](https://github.com/junzis/). I am an assistant professor at TU Delft. My research is in the CNS/ATM domain, and often with lots of data.
- [@espinielli](https://github.com/espinielli/). Interested in dataviz and looking forward to a world where human brains are freed from boring, repetitive, manual, click-copy-paste tasks.
