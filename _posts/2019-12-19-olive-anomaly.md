The city pair data set consists of one full year of 3536 trajectories flying
from Paris--Orly (LFPO) to Toulouse--Blagnac (LFBO) airports between January and
December 2017. This data set has been requested based on a set of 28 callsigns
commonly attributed to trajectories serving this route.

The airspace data set consists of seven months of trajectories flying through
the LFBBPT airspace of the French Bordeaux Area Control Centre (ACC) between
January 1st and August 6th 2017. The data set is limited to 14,461 trajectories
crossing the airspace during the time intervals when the sector was
operationally deployed according to the Sector Configurations Plans (SCP), also
known as opening schemes. The goal of using the SCP is for the traffic under
analysis to be representative of operational situations with a level of workload
deemed acceptable by controllers.

The landing data set consists of 19,480 trajectories landing at Zurich airport
(LSZH) between October 1st and November 30rd 2019. We relied on The OpenSky
Network database to properly label trajectories landing at LSZH.
