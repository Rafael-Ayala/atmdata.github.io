The dataset contains full time series of radar images, weather models and ground observations.
To keep the dataset at a reasonable size, the data covers two geographic areas of 550km x 550km on the Mediterranean and Brittany coasts, and spans over 3 years, 2016 to 2018.

The data have been carefully chosen to remain reasonable in size. The full dataset weights 172GB but most packages are only a few GB. If you have a small hard drive, you can download only part of them.
